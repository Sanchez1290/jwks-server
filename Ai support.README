### AI Support Disclosure

ChatGPT (OpenAI) was used as a learning and troubleshooting tool while working on this project.
It helped me better understand JWKS/JWT concepts (such as `kid` values, key expiration, and JWKS formatting) and provided guidance when I got stuck during implementation.
I mainly used it to ask questions about endpoint behavior, debugging issues, and testing ideas. Example prompts included: “How should a JWKS server return public keys?”, “How does a JWT include a kid in the header?”, and “Why might my JWT validation fail?”.
All coding, implementation, testing, and final project decisions were completed by me.
